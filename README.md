# Thinking in React

This is an adaptation of the classic [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
tutorial.  It's been updated to run as a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
project and components have been split out into separate files.

The component code in this project matches the code from [Step 2 of Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react), with a few small stylistic changes.

I suggest reading through the original tutorial and updating the code in this project as you follow along.
